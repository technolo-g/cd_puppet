# Puppet in a Continuous Delivery Environment

## Outline

1. What is Continuous Deployment (CD)?
    - CD is a methodology that reduces the length of feedback cycles for the teams involved in developing and releasing software by introducing automation to the error prone manual stages.
    - A CD Pipeline is a name for the system that brings software through its lifecycle. This normally begins with pre-commit testing and continues through commit testing, packaging of the artifact, automated acceptance testing, deployment to TEST, deployment to STAGE, and deployment to PROD
    - What problems does CD address?
        * Complex, manual, risky release processes
            - Done differently every time
            - Loosely organized
                * Who is doing what task?
        * Long times to release
